FIREBASE FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES
=================================

To fix the Firebase permission-denied errors, you need to update your Firestore Security Rules in the Firebase Console.

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Click on "Rules" tab
5. Replace the existing rules with the following:

---BEGIN RULES---
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow public read access to carousel data
    match /carousel/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated users can write
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to pizze data
    match /pizze/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to valori data
    match /valori/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to ingredienti data
    match /ingredienti/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to gallery data
    match /gallery/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
      // Allow public read access to settings data
    match /settings/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to team data
    match /team/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Default rule - deny access to other collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
---END RULES---

FIREBASE STORAGE SECURITY RULES
================================

You also need to configure Firebase Storage rules to allow image uploads.

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Storage
4. Click on "Rules" tab
5. Replace the existing rules with the following:

---BEGIN STORAGE RULES---
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to upload images to carousel folder
    match /carousel/{filename} {
      allow read: if true; // Anyone can read carousel images
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated users can upload
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to upload images to pizze folder
    match /pizze/{filename} {
      allow read: if true; // Anyone can read pizza images
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated users can upload
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to upload images to gallery folder
    match /gallery/{filename} {
      allow read: if true; // Anyone can read gallery images
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated users can upload
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to upload images to ingredienti folder
    match /ingredienti/{filename} {
      allow read: if true; // Anyone can read ingredient images
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated users can upload
    }
    
    // Default rule - deny access to other folders
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated users for other folders
    }
  }
}
---END STORAGE RULES---

6. Click "Publish" to apply the rules

WHAT THESE RULES DO:
===================

FIRESTORE RULES:
- Allow anyone to READ data from: carousel, pizze, valori, ingredienti, gallery, settings, team
- Only authenticated users can WRITE/MODIFY data
- All other collections require authentication for both read and write

STORAGE RULES:
- Allow anyone to READ images from: carousel, pizze, gallery, ingredienti folders
- Only authenticated users can UPLOAD images
- All other folders require authentication for both read and write

COMPLETE SETUP STEPS:
====================
1. Apply FIRESTORE rules (Firestore Database → Rules)
2. Apply STORAGE rules (Storage → Rules)
3. Run the import-carousel-data.html script to populate the database
4. Test admin panel carousel section

TESTING:
========
After applying BOTH sets of rules:
1. Open your website
2. Check the browser console (F12)
3. You should see no more "permission-denied" errors
4. The carousel and other Firebase content should load properly
5. Admin panel should be able to upload images without storage/unauthorized errors

FALLBACK BEHAVIOR:
==================
If Firebase is unavailable or has issues, your website will gracefully fall back to:
- Static HTML carousel slides on index.html
- Static HTML content on chi-siamo.html
- This ensures your website always works, even without Firebase
